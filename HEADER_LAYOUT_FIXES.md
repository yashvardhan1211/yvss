# Header Layout Bug Fixes

## 🐛 Issues Fixed

### 1. **Cramped Header Layout**
- **Problem**: All elements (logo, navigation, actions) were squeezed into one row
- **Solution**: Split into two-tier header structure

### 2. **Overlapping Elements**
- **Problem**: Navigation items and action buttons were overlapping
- **Solution**: Separated into distinct header bars with proper spacing

### 3. **Poor Mobile Experience**
- **Problem**: Header was unusable on mobile devices
- **Solution**: Responsive design with collapsible navigation

## ✅ New Header Structure

### **Top Header Bar**
```
[LOGO] Babuu Grooming India    [📍 Location] [🛍️ (0)] [📋 (0)] [Owner]
```
